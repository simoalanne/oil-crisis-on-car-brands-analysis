### Oil crisis effects on cars

## Introduction

This repository includes scripts to resarch the effects of oil crises on the manufacturing
specifications of cars. The data has been forked from UCI Machine Learning Repository's data and
we have expanded upon it slightly using Google's Gemini Pro 3 and also fix any mistakes and converting
units into metric.
